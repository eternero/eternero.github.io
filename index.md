title: "3M-RS : Multi-Modal Music Recommendation System"

# About
Our project, 3M-RS proposes the development of a Multi-Modal Music Recommendation System. The approach that we propose departs
from traditional solutions. Instead of heavily relying on **Collaborative Filtering** (CF) and past user behavior, which have
shown to cause issues like _popularity bias_ and _filter bubbles_, our solution is byuilt around the intrinsic characterisics
of the music itself.


By leveraging audio analysis, user-generated content (e.g. social tags), and direct user input, our system aims to offer a more
equitable, transparent, and user-controlled recommendation experience.
